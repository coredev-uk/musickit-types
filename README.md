# musickit-types
Typescript types for Apple's MusicKit.js Library. Adapted from DefinitelyTyped.

> [!NOTE]  
> This contains types for both the [Production](https://js-cdn.music.apple.com/musickit/v3/musickit.js) verison of MusicKit and the more ['beta' version](https://beta.music.apple.com/includes/js-cdn/musickit/v3/amp/musickit.js) aquired from Apple's Website. There are slight differences between this, as you may notice, but primarily the types serve both libraries.
